# Remove/Customize Startup Videos

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of July 18th patch. They added some file verification that will not let your sign in with modified startup videos. You can still disable the startup videos if you modify `DefaultEngine.ini` and remove relevant code or deleting the startup video files. I could not find a way to get custom startup videos.
{% endhint %}

## Download and Install RAD Tools:

## Creating BINK Video

1. Open RAD Video Tools
2. Browse to your Video in the File Browser and select it
3. Press “Bink it!”
4. In the newly opened window press “Bink”
5. Wait for the Conversion to finish, then press done

The Video will now be in the same folder as the original video and converted to a `.bik` file

## Changing startup videos with custom video.

1. Go to path: `Steam\steamapps\common\Mission 202\RxGame\Movies`.
2. Place your newly made `.bik` video in this folder.
3. Copy the name of one of the existing videos, then change the name to something else.
   * Example: `FrontEndUnrealLogo.bik` to `FrontEndUnrealLogo_old.bik`.&#x20;
4. Change your videos filename to which ever existing video you chose.&#x20;
   * Example: `myvideo.bik` to `FrontEndUnrealLogo.bik`.

At this point, you effectively changed the video the startup video to a custom one.&#x20;

## Removing the remaining (or all) startup videos.

1. Rename the rest (or all) of the videos so the game cannot find the videos and can't play them on startup.
   * Alternatively, you could also delete them, move them, or create completely black single frame videos to play instead.&#x20;

## You now have custom startup videos!&#x20;
